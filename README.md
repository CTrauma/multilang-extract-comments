> Extract comments from source files of various languages

## Overview

multilang-extract-comments is a package for extracting comments from source-code. It is compatible with the 
`extract-comments`-package by Jon Schlinkert:

It provides an extended API, which allows you to extract comments not only from JavaScript
files, but also from Python, C, Handlebars etc.

The module is inspired by `extract-comment`. It's purpose is to allow `verb` to extract of
jsdoc-like comments from other files as well. The primary targets are Handlebars-files, for 
documenting [bootprint template-modules](https://github.com/nknapp/bootprint).

## Example (JavaScript)

For the following string:

```js
/**
 * A javascript multiline-comment
 * with multiple lines
 */
function aLineOfCode () {
}

// A single line comments
// More of it directly below
function anotherFunction () {
  aLineOfCode()
}

anotherFunction()

```

and the following code

```js
var comments = require('multilang-extract-comments')(string);
```

The variable `comments` now contains:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "begin": 1,
    "end": 4,
    "codeStart": 5,
    "content": "A javascript multiline-comment\nwith multiple lines\n",
    "code": "function aLineOfCode () {"
  },
  "8": {
    "begin": 8,
    "end": 10,
    "codeStart": 10,
    "content": "A single line comments\nMore of it directly below\n",
    "code": "function anotherFunction () {"
  }
}
```

Also have a look at the usage example of `extract-comments`

## Example (Handlebars)

For the following string:

```hbs
{{!
   This is an example
   of a handlebars multiline-comment.
}}
Some code here
```

and the following code

```hbs
var comments = require('multilang-extract-comments')(string, { filename: 'handlebars.hbs'});
```

The variable `comments` now contains:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "begin": 1,
    "end": 4,
    "codeStart": 5,
    "content": "This is an example\nof a handlebars multiline-comment.\n",
    "code": "Some code here"
  }
}
```
